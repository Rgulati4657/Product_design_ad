## My process

### Built with

-  HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS 


I learned about like use properties rather to follow someone use it according to own comfort and i learned how to approach when design any layout.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="product">
```
```css
@media  screen and (max-width : 530px) {
    .product{
        display: block;
        min-width: 90vw;
        height: auto;
        border-radius: 0.8rem 0.8rem;
    }
    .product__pic{
        background-image: url(./images/image-product-mobile.jpg);
        background-size: cover;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-color: var(--Cream);
        height: 260px;
        border-radius: 0.8rem 0.8rem 0rem 0rem;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
i wanna more focus on how to align each and every content in more comfortable way.


### Useful resources

once i was thinking to write perfume in capital letter rather to apply property and suddenly i forgot which provide can help me to make it uppercase so i firgure it out on Google  i.e. text-transform
